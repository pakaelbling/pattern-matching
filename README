To compile the code, run SML/NJ and then type

  - CM.make("sources.cm"); 

at the prompt.

There are three stub files you need to fill in:

  check.sml          fill in the function check
  step.sml           fill in the function progress
  tasks.fpc          

where NUMBER is a string of digits, and NAME is a string of letters. 

To test out your code there is a top-level structure, Top.

Structure of the support code:

syntax.sml              implementation of syntax

check.sml               implementation of type checker

step.sml                implementation of evaluator

top.sml                 read-eval-print loop

stream.sml              stream library
input.sml               library for reading files/stdin as streams
lexer.sml               lexer (convert strings to tokens)
parse.sml               parser (concrete to abstract syntax)
print.sml               pretty printer
